    "    There is no significant difference in student grades between traditional public and charter school, but there is in the number of students approved by the state tests. In the traditional public school 73% students were approved in reading and math, but only 66% succeeded in math. While, 93% charter school students succeeded in math and 96% in reading, totalizing 95% passed in charter school.\n",
